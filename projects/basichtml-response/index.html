      <h1>making the web “folksy”</h1>
      <p>The notes in this reading on the folk revival hit very close to home for me. Growing up in the Blue Ridge mountains, I took for granted the deep and nuanced folk history there. Whether it was learning which “holler” someone lived in, or the minor interactions in Floyd, VA on bluegrass nights, or the endless stands of jarred goods along the roads. <br>
      <br>
      I grew up in that culture without ever realizing how unique and special it must be. Reading how the author of this article truly marveled at such a thing as canning really puts everything into perspective, and makes me feel like I grew up in a really special place. <br>
      <br>
      One point of discussion that could come from this article is how to define what makes a “folk” craft folksy. Is it really only the age of the practice that would qualify it as folksy? I don’t think that’s entirely fair. The folk arts are also rooted in deep respect for conservation, for nature, and for community. In some of these ways, it seems that the basic definition the author offers of “basic html” does not align with what one could consider folksy. <br>
      <br>
      Finally, aside from age, folk art typically possesses some kind of utility. It’s never just decorative. The last point that I wholeheartedly agree with is that folk art, punk art, and mid-90’s nostalgic websites all call back to the “handmade”. This factor alone is inarguably the reason that this article was written. For all there is to discuss and define, what I appreciate most is the handmade as it has affected web design.
