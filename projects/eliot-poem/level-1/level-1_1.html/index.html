    Preludes<br>
    by T. S. Eliot<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    I<br>
    <br>
    The winter evening settles down<br>
    With smell of steaks in passageways.<br>
    Six o’clock.<br>
    The burnt-out ends of smoky days.<br>
    And now a gusty shower wraps<br>
    The grimy scraps<br>
    Of withered leaves about your feet<br>
    And newspapers from vacant lots;<br>
    The showers beat<br>
    On broken blinds and chimney-pots,<br>
    And at the corner of the street<br>
    A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps.<br>
    <br>
    And then the lighting of the lamps.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    II<br>
    <br>
    The morning comes to consciousness<br>
    Of faint stale smells of beer<br>
    From the sawdust-trampled street<br>
    With all its muddy feet that press<br>
    To early coffee-stands.<br>
    With the other masquerades<br>
    That time resumes,<br>
    One thinks of all the hands<br>
    That are raising dingy shades<br>
    In a thousand furnished rooms.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    III<br>
    <br>
    You tossed a blanket from the bed,<br>
    You lay upon your back, and waited;<br>
    You dozed, and watched the night revealing<br>
    The thousand sordid images<br>
    Of which your soul was constituted;<br>
    They flickered against the ceiling.<br>
    And when all the world came back<br>
    And the light crept up between the shutters<br>
    And you heard the sparrows in the gutters,<br>
    You had such a vision of the street<br>
    As the street hardly understands;<br>
    Sitting along the bed’s edge, where<br>
    You curled the papers from your hair,<br>
    Or clasped the yellow soles of feet<br>
    In the palms of both soiled hands.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    IV<br>
    <br>
    His soul stretched tight across the skies<br>
    That fade behind a city block,<br>
    Or trampled by insistent feet<br>
    At four and five and six o’clock;<br>
    And short square fingers stuffing pipes,<br>
    And evening newspapers, and eyes<br>
    Assured of certain certainties,<br>
    The conscience of a blackened street<br>
    Impatient to assume the world.<br>
    <br>
    I am moved by fancies that are curled<br>
    Around these images, and cling:<br>
    The notion of some infinitely gentle<br>
    Infinitely suffering thing.<br>
    <br>
    Wipe your hand across your mouth, and laugh;<br>
    The worlds revolve like ancient women<br>
    Gathering fuel in vacant lots.<br>
