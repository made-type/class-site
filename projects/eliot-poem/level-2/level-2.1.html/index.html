    <h1>Sonatas II and IV</h1>
    <h2>by T. S. Eliot</h2>
    <br>
    <em>
    <big><strong>II</strong></big><br>
    The morning comes to consciousness<br>
    Of faint stale smells of beer<br>
    From the sawdust-trampled street<br>
    With all its muddy feet that press<br>
    To early coffee-stands.<br>
    With the other masquerades<br>
    That time resumes,<br>
    One thinks of all the hands<br>
    That are raising dingy shades<br>
    In a thousand furnished rooms.<br>
<br>
<br>
    <big><strong>IV</strong></big><br>
    His soul stretched tight across the skies<br>
    That fade behind a city block,<br>
    Or trampled by insistent feet<br>
    At four and five and six oâ€™clock;<br>
    And short square fingers stuffing pipes,<br>
    And evening newspapers, and eyes<br>
    Assured of certain certainties,<br>
    The conscience of a blackened street<br>
    Impatient to assume the world.<br>
<br>
    I am moved by fancies that are curled<br>
    Around these images, and cling:<br>
    The notion of some infinitely gentle<br>
    Infinitely suffering thing.<br>
<br>

    Wipe your hand across your mouth, and laugh;<br>
    The worlds revolve like ancient women<br>
    Gathering fuel in vacant lots.<br>
